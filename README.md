This is *meant* to be a fullstack questionaire app that draws data from a MySQL table and displays the questions
for the user to answer dynamically, showing one of the bunch at a time.

In the app, ideally you would be able to click buttons on the side like the provided example for me to follow,
it opens the first question in that category and continues on if its wrong or right.

However, as you can likely tell already, from demoing it. things arent even close to working. I'm badly struggling
 with the middleware side of things, as the most common errors I have gotten during testing are:
"Error at line 1, row 1 of TABLE" (or something along those lines) and
"TypeError('Router.use() requires a middleware function but got a ' + gettype(fn))"

That all being said, thus far this is my best attempt at this prompt;
